# Data-analysis-on-crime-dataset

The dataset we use are mainly from wprdc.org, which is managed by the University of Pittsburgh’s Center for Social and Urban Research. The first dataset we use is Police Blotter from 2013 to 2017, what we did in the first step is to divide the entire dataset into different years, then count the total number of crimes in each census tract, the second step would be get the population in different census and normalize the crime count. In the process of getting populations in each census tract, we first wrote a python script making api requests from census.gov to get populations in each census tract under the suggestion of another project, after some research from census.gov, we found it’s more complicated to write requests than get population datasets from factfinder.census.gov, so we gave up the code we wrote and used the dataset from factfinder under the suggestion of another classmate. After the population is ready, we normalized the crime data in each census tract,  after that we try to plot this as a second layer to the interactive map, but it’s then we find the shape file we use to plot the second and the crime rate uses different format of census tracts, which make it difficult to plot the crime rate on the map, after some debugging and consideration, we decide to redo the process from the beginning. So we have to go back to the first step where we have to combine the crime data with shape and zip file using the lat and lon in the crime dataset to get the twelve digits of census tract, but now the problem became the census tract has twelve digits, but population has eleven digits, so even though we can remove one digit then make them the same, but there’s potential that the two census tract might not correspond to each other, but at this point, we consider the effect is minor.
